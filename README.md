HTTP Server made from Sockets and â™¥
====================================

This is an HTTP server. It's not particularly advanced, but it's 100% home made!

In order to be a good server we must do the following
-----------------------------------------------------

* [x] Test our web server with an HttpClient
* [x] Respond to GET requests
* [x] Parse query paths
* [ ] Serve static pages
* [ ] Create an executable jar-file
* [ ] Refactor out the common parts between the client and the server
* [ ] Respond to POST requests
* [ ] Create a Controller abstraction
